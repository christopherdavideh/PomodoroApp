# PomodoroApp
Application made with Xamarin.Forms that allows us to apply the pomodoro technique to maximize our concentration. We use the MVVM design pattern. The app has the following functions:

- Creation of Pomodoros.
- Configuration of the number of pomodoros to be executed.
- Setting the time that the pomodoro lasts.
- Setting the pause time.
- Finish the pomodoro at any time.
- The data is stored in the Application's Own Resources Dictionary.
- Use of Xamarin Shell to app navigation.
- Customizing CircularProgress Control for Android.
